=====Start test operator=====
a = 1
a += 1, a = 2
a -= 1, a = 1
a *= 2, a = 2
a /= 2, a = 1
a = 7, a %= 4, a = 3
a <<= 1, a = 6
a >>= 1, a = 3
a &= 5, a = 1
a |= 4, a = 5
a ^= 3, a = 6

=====Start test conditional=====
(2 < 3 ? 2 : 3) is 2
(2 > 3 ? 2 : 3) is 3

=====Start test assignment=====
a = 1
a = a + 1, a = 2
a = a - 1, a = 1
a = a * 2, a = 2
a = a / 2, a = 1
a = 7, a %= 4, a = 3
a = a << 1, a = 6
a = a >> 3, a = 3
a = a & 3, a = 1
a = a | 3, a = 5
a = a ^ 3, a = 6

=====Start test logical and or=====
a = 0
(2 < 3 && (a += 1)) is false
and now a = 0
((a += 1) && (3 > 2 || (a += 1))) is true
and now a = 1

=====Start test switch=====
should be 2
should be 2
should be 4
should be 4
should be 5
should be 6
